# Transfer learning
Transfer learning is the idea of overcoming the isolated learning paradigm and utilizing knowledge acquired for one task to solve related ones.  
  
Transfer learning has several benefits, but the main advantages are saving training time, better performance of neural networks (in most cases), and not needing a lot of data
